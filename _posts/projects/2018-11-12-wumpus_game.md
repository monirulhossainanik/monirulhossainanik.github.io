title: Wumpus Game
---

>Wumpus worldâ€”that provides plenty of motivation for logical reasoning. Wumpus was an early computer game, based on an agent who explores a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. Lurking somewhere in the cave is the wumpus, a beast that eats anyone who enters its room. To make matters worse, some rooms contain bottomless pits that will trap anyone who wanders into these rooms (except for the wumpus, who is too big to fall in). The only mitigating feature of living in this environment is the occasional heap of gold.

<h4>Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the square containing the wumpus and in the directly (not diagonally) adjacent squares
the agent will perceive a stench</li>
<li>In the squares directly adjacent to a pit, the agent will perceive a breeze</li>
<li>In the square where the gold is, the agent will perceive a glitter</li>
<li>The percepts will be given to the agent in the form of a list of five symbols; for example,
if there is a stench, a breeze, and a glitter</li>
<li>There are actions to go forward, upward, left, right but not diagonal</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is to grab gold</li>
</ul>
